# TODO

- Scene file: A file that stores scene information (gameobjects, their components and component values).
- Asset manager: A way to manage assets (such as scene files)
- Build game: A way to build the game, resulting in an executable that doesn't have all the engine features, only the gameplay stuff.
- Script component: An Angel script or Luau scripting component that lets us add game logic to gameObjects.
- Better Transforms: We can make a test scene with 1000s of static/moving gameObjects and benchmark. Current -> (maybe look at Freya's Rotation) -> Transform matrix -> cache or something
